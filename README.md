# The Machine Learning Module

Explore the relation between variables using data-driven methods for regression, classification, and clustering.

## Core Functionality

The Machine Learning module bundles several `R` packages for machine learning into a general interface for training a predictive model and assessing its performance on holdout data. The module offers a variety of supervised an unsupervised learning methods whose parameters can be adjusted. Moreover, the module facilitates different data splitting methods for dividing data into a training, testing, and validation set.
